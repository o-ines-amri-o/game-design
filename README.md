## 🧩 Gameplay Mechanics

- **You are a Sardine:**  
  Start your journey alone as an adventurous fish in a large aquatic reservoir.

- **Use Your Mouse:**  
  Control your sardine using the mouse. Navigate the waters, dodge hazards, and collect food.

  Find floating food and give it to other sardines. Feeding a fish makes it follow you. Build your team one ally at a time!

  Once **30 sardines** are following you, you’ll unlock **Level 2**, where new challenges and smarter predators await.

  Be careful! Fishing rods, rival fish shoal, and other surprises are out to break up your team.
